    <p class ="Facts">Here we will get to learn a lot about the various facts.Planet Earth. That shiny blue marble that has fascinated humanity 
        since they first began to walk across its surface. And why shouldnâ€™t it fascinate us? In addition to being our home and the
         place where life as we know it originated, it remains the only planet we know of where life thrives. 
         And over the course of the past few centuries, we have learned much about Earth,which has only deepened our fascination with it.</p>
        <h2>1. Plate Tectonics Keep the Planet Comfortable:</h2><p>Earth is the only planet in the Solar System with plate tectonics. 
            Basically, the outer crust of the Earth is broken up into regions known as tectonic plates. These are floating on top of the 
         magma interior of the Earth and can move against one another. When two plates collide, one plate will subduct (go underneath another),
     and where they pull apart, they will allow fresh crust to form.</p>
     <h2>2. Earth is Almost a Sphere:</h2><p>Many people tend to think that the Earth is a sphere. In fact, between the 6th cenury
          BCE and the modern era, this remained the scientific consensus. But thanks to modern astronomy and space travel, scientists
           have since come to understand that the Earth is actually shaped like a flattened sphere (aka. an oblate spheroid).</p>
